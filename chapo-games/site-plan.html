      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a computer programmer.
        I am also an avid gamer in constant search for new games.
        I am a broke college student always looking for discount deals on said games.
        My company makes it easy to find games and great discounts. 
        My company built a website to help you find video games and discounts to save you money.
        Think about the last time you were on the hunt for a new game: could you have found it cheaper? 
        That's what my website is for! We make it easier to find games curated for your tastes and your wallet!
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My targeted audience are the gamers. Whether your a gamer who is into trash talking 11 year olds on CAll of Duty.
          Or perhaps a pro gamer streaming to hundreds of people on Twitch. Or maybe you're a more casual player who is
          more into single player experiences, going at your own pace to relax at the end of a long day. My company is for 
          all types of gamers, who are just interested in getting the best deals they can when making purchases, while
          not having to worry about if there are better deals out there they are just not aware of.
          An informed gamer is a Powerful Gamer.
